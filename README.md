# Permissionless.js Starter kit

This starter kit is designed to help you quickly get up and running with smart accounts (Account abstraction) powered by Permissionless.js and Pimlico. It utilizes Next.js, React, shadcn/ui, wagmi , viem and Web3Auth.

Bear in mind this still very much a work in progress and will improve over time
